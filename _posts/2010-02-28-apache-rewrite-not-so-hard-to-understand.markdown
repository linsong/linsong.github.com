title: apache rewrite, not so hard to understand
published: false

Recently, I do a lot of apache configurations. Several times I got stuck on mod_rewrite, that seems to be complex. At first, I just ask google for my question, that is the first method I will try whenever I get a question. It is quick, but now I know that is not always the best way to get answers.

At last I encountered a mod_rewrite that I can not get answer from google, I have to get a cup of water, sit down quietly to study apache mod_rewrite's docs. I have to admit, apache's documentation is well organized and written.
